# Fitness App API

This is a back end solution for Fitness App project.
A demo is deployed here on https://sleepy-sea-10905.herokuapp.com/api

## Instalation
In order to run the source code you must have Node.js and npm installed. 
To install the required dependencies open a terminal and run the following command:  
```
npm install
```
This will add needed node_modules described under "dependecies" in the package.json file.

Finally you can start the project locally by running:
```
node index.js
```
